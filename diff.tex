%
% I follow the suggestion given in [B] to write the following abstract.
An interoperable \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cyber-physical system }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and geospatial Cyber-Physical System (CPS) }\DIFaddend -- called \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{AgriMetSupport }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Agri\-Met\-Support }\DIFaddend -- was implemented to manage sensor networks, weather stations, agrometeorological data, and services that can be developed sequentially (e.g., models enabling territorial and integrated risk management).
Such a system could become crucial to support anyone responsible for establishing and maintaining an advanced sensor network, including territorial bodies, researchers, data analysts, and other stakeholders such as consortia of farmers, and those providing point and gridded sensor data support within research and development projects.
In the context of agrometeorological networks, this task is becoming increasingly difficult because it is required to deal with complex operations carried out using agrometeorological data such as data storage, quality check, missing data management, build continuous raster maps by means of geospatial modelling, data sharing with stakeholders and so forth.
In addition, responsible entities should implement these actions by pursuing complimentary objectives such as the adoption of standardized, scientifically-sound and perhaps shared procedures among federated territories.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{AgriMetSupport }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Agri\-Met\-Support }\DIFaddend is made by physical, software and modular components which are all specifically designed to build an operative cyber-physical system supporting responsable entities in their management and planning tasks, but also any other stakeholder dealing with the production or the consumption of either sensor data or any kind of service based on these data.
The fundamental aim of the work proposed in this paper is to validate the production of qualified and certified data using well-tuned procedures available along with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{AgriMetSupport}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Agri\-Met\-Support}\DIFaddend .
The main finding is that such a cyber-physical structure can be spread to distinct territories (or distinct networks within the same territory) or can be used as the centralised system to manage federated monitoring networks.
It can ease the management of sensor networks by responsible entities while leaving complex issues to researchers or domain experts.

%Include the big picture: The Earth Critical Zone requires that models such as SPA and pest models have quality checked data.
%\begin{itemize} 
%    \item Problem statement
%    \item Related work
%    \item Objectives
%\end{itemize}

% ==== Earth Critical Zone ====
%It is a living, breathing, constantly evolving boundary layer where rock, soil, water, air, and living organisms interact. These complex interactions regulate the natural habitat and determine the availability of life-sustaining resources, including our food production and water quality.
%The Critical Zone (CZ) is the support system for all terrestrial ecosystems, extending from unweathered rock to the top of any vegetation canopy. In the CZ, physical, biological, geological and hydrological processes interact at multiple temporal and spatial scales.
%Earth's critical zone is the “heterogeneous, near surface environment in which complex interactions involving rock, soil, water, air, and living organisms regulate the natural habitat and determine the availability of life-sustaining resources”
\DIFaddbegin \statusblock{}{wip}{NOTES: (1) remove any reference to GCI and use CPS in the whole paper; (2) check that at crucial locations in the manuscript I highlight the distinct feature of \textit{geospatial} for my CPS.}

\DIFaddend Climate controls the Earth's Critical Zone (ECZ) in combination with other physical, biological and geological processes.
The ECZ is a heterogeneous system extending from the top of the vegetation canopy to the bottom of unweathered rocks, regulates the availability of resources and modulates the production of ecosystem services such as the filtration and quality of water, and the production of food and fibre.

%Weather: Physical state of the atmosphere at a given place and given time. Eg. Cloudy day
%Climate: Long term regime of atmospheric variables of a given place or area. Eg. Cold season
%and considered as basic input or resources in agricultural planning, every plant process related with growth development and yield of a crop is affected by weather.

Weather and climate are the most important dynamic components of the ECZ determining the physical \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{condition }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{conditions }\DIFaddend in which animals and plants are grown.
Weather is the physical state of the atmosphere at any spatiotemporal coordinate, while climate represents an aggregation of atmospheric variables mostly over time (e.g. seasonal extremes) but also in the spatial domain (e.g. regional extremes).
Agricultural meteorology is concerned with the monitoring of weather and the characterisation of the meteorological, hydrological and pedological factors that have a direct effect on agriculture and the production of crops and livestocks.
% http://www.agriinfo.in/default.aspx?page=topic&superid=1&topicid=377
Agricultural meteorology is deemed important considering the large amount of ground stations available worldwide to monitor the behaviour of weather elements, notwithstanding, for instance, the huge amounts of air-borne proxy products coming from massive satellite monitoring.
Indeed, amongst others, it helps: 
    \begin{enumerate*}
        \item understanding the realisation of several crop parameters such as the growing season and the harvesting time;  \citep{Hoogenboom:agrometeo-swat:2000,Chou2019,Madhukar2021,Richmond2022};
        \item managing crops by means of various farm operations such as fertilisers application and irrigation scheduling \citep{Cammarano2021,Chen2020};
        \item assessing the suitability of specific crops both in space for instance by means of agroclimatic zoning and in time in particular according to climate change \citep{Rokochynskiy2020,Jiang2020};
        \item crop and livestock monitoring and modelling \citep{Vogel2021,Zhang2022};
        \item understanding the spatial distribution of soil types and soil properties since climate is one of the soil forming factors recognized in both CLORPT \citep{jenny:clorpt:1941} and SCORPAN \citep{McBratney:scorpan:2003} models;
        \item forecasting plant pests and diseases \citep{IPM_decisions}.
    \end{enumerate*}

\subsection{Related work}
There is an increasing demand for the production, in digital format, of weather and climatic data of good quality within the earth critical zone both 
    for practical applications (e.g. the need to know climatic patterns in a farm to improve the management)
    and
    for research and development, in particular to simulate the soil-plant-atmosphere system \citep{Hoogenboom:agrometeo-swat:2000,Jones:swat:2003,Seneviratne:swat:2010} % \citep{Langella:rainann:2010}
    and the risk of pests \citep{Orlandini:plasmopara:2008,Rossi:vitenet:2014}.
    % \citep{Terribile:dssvitis:2017}
The demand is particularly burdensome considering the requirement to handle climatic data both at finer temporal scale and in a continuous spatial domain.
It means that daily (e.g. in the soil hydrological modelling) or even hourly records (e.g. in the phytopathologic risk modelling) measured at point gauges sparsely located in a territory must be transformed in three dimensional climatic data cubes (Longitude, Latitude, Time) by means of statistically sound geospatial procedures.
% (there is a gap between the major of scientific modelling approaches that requires digital climate maps and the gauged measurements).
There exist few approaches implementing and deploying automatic spatial inference engines of this kind based on point agrometeorological data at the daily or even at the hourly time step.
One example working in USA using already checked daily data, is given by the expert-based model called PRISM developed by  \cite{Daly08_PRISM_USA}. %\note{(search for other REFs? may be sufficient!)}

% ==== Aim ====
%Support systems to agrometeorological practices and services comprise data (so quantification), research, training/education/extension and policy environments. Especially in industrialized countries mathematical models are increasingly used in operational agricultural meteorology, in conjunction with Geographic Information Systems (GISs) to provide inputs to Decision Support Systems (DSSs).
Especially in more developed countries, mathematical models are increasingly used in agriculture in conjunction with Geographic Information Systems (GISs), also via web in the form of WebGIS, to provide inputs to Decision Support Systems (DSSs), possibly via web in the form of Web Based geoSpatial Decision Support Systems (WB-SDSS).
Examples of WB-SDSS can be found 
for heavy metal pollution management in soils \citep{Wang:wbsdss:2017}, 
for livestock manure management \citep{Acutis:wbsdss:2014}, 
for locust prevention and control \citep{Yao:wbsdss:2017}, 
for optimized crop irrigation \citep{Giusti:wbsdss:2015}, 
for land management and soil conservation \citep{Terribile:LandSupport:2024}, 
for early warning systems in areas of weather and climate \citep{Bopape_2019},
and so forth.
%\review{ include also examples of possibile similar GCIs such as \citep{Bopape_2019}...; hydrometeorological;  }
There exist a huge production of DSS tools on quite every issue related to the agricultural and forestry systems.
%\note{what is missing? a GCI on agrometerological data to facilitate the assembly of tools to support decision process in issues related to agriculture and forestry.  }

Results obtained on scopus.com (Jan 2025) reveals that \textbf{CHECK}(386) documents (articles, reviews and books) were published on cyber infrastructures applied in (agro-)meteorology, while none of them were relevant to the peculiar scope of this work.
A search with "Cyber Physical System Agriculture Meteorology" returned \textbf{CHECK}(few documents) such as \cite{sarkar24CPS}.
It appears that existing CPSs primarily focus on single-location environments, whereas Agri\-Met\-Support is designed to address the complexities of heterogeneous landscapes and diverse territories by incorporating sensor networks. 
This unique feature is advantageous since crucial operations such as the quality check and data gap infilling at each location leverage information from other locations.\\
Highlight pros and cons.\\
Pros:
\begin{itemize}
    \item management of sensor networks; 
    \item WeatherProg modules dedicated to quality control, gap infilling, spatial interpolation and gridded datacubes;
    \item AMS is a geospatial CPS differently from other CPSs (highlight its ability to process geospatial data in real time; differentiate it from generic CPS that might not handle spatial information (at least in AGRI- domain); strengthen its connection to agrometeorology, where spatial data is key)
\end{itemize}
Cons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Agri\-Met\-Support by design misses the actuation modules even though it provides APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to data and modeling components to feed external services implementing actions;
    \item others?
\end{itemize}}

\subsection{Objectives}
% Research Problem:
Effective management and planning in agricultural meteorology require accurate, high-quality, and continuously updated data.
However, the increasing complexity of agrometeorological networks, coupled with the need for standardized and scientifically sound procedures, poses significant challenges for stakeholders responsible for these tasks.
To address these challenges, a comprehensive solution through the development of a modular and interoperable \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cyber-physical system, called AgriMetSupport, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Cyber-Physical System (CPS) }\DIFaddend is proposed.

% Objectives:
To achieve this goal, the present study focuses on the following objectives:
\begin{enumerate}

    NOTES: I have to highlight two distinct things:\\
     1) research: how AMS becomes useful, for instance to develop and validate models in agriculture, such as pest, soil, etc. I can provide the two examples at steps 6 and 9 of both \cref{Fig:WeatherProg} and \cref{Box01:WeatherProg_Operations}. Discuss how AgriMetSupport supports new research opportunities, such as monitoring microclimate dynamics, testing novel agronomic models, or evaluating extreme weather impacts.\\
     2) science: this is very difficult! I have to brainstorm about it\\
     FURTHER: Contributo alla ricerca: Devo prendere lo step 6 e/o 9 di WeatherProg e illustrare il vantaggio dal punto di vista della ricerca e scientifico nell’avere i moduli fondamentali di “aggiustamento” del dato (check + infill), applicati ad esempio nella messa a punto di un modello parassitario (e posso richiamare i due esempi prodotti negli step 6 e 9).
Contributo scientifico: il meccanismo di perturbazione e di validazione incrociata (NON CREDO DI AVERLO MAI CITATO NEL PAPER: POSSO PUNTARE SU QUESTO ASPETTO; IN REALTA’ LA VALIDAZIONE INCROCIATA È GIÀ IN ESSERE PER INFILL, MENTRE L’UNICO MODO PER TESTARE IL CONTROLLO DI QUALITÀ È INTRODURRE NOISE) può generare delle statistiche in termini di incertezza / errore che possono essere utilizzati sia per misurare la performance di AMS che per determinare la propagazione dell’incertezza e dell’errore nelle applicazioni e servizi a valle.

\DIFadd{Agri\-Met\-Support }\DIFaddend is designed to be a comprehensive framework for agrometereological monitoring and data management.
It can be effectively used for a wide range of purposes, from simple agrometeorogical monitoring to digital climatic maps production and agricultual and forestry modeling and application, including predictive pest modeling.

This way, responsible entities can actually derive their own tailored instances from the general model of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{AgriMetSupport}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Agri\-Met\-Support}\DIFaddend .

The high-level architecture is illustrated in \cref{cyberPhysicalSystemFig}.

Agri\-Met\-Support is capable of handling and integrating data coming from multiple heterogeneous networks of stations, possibly under the responsibility of different stakeholders working in the same territory.
Each network can include different kinds of station \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and sensor}\DIFaddend , and each network can submit data to AgriMetSupport in different formats, since the decoding module of WeatherProg can be configured to accommodate such differences.
The opportunity to integrate networks is of paramount importance to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{systematically }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{sys\-tem\-at\-ic\-al\-ly

%and reciprocal impact both on the different agencies sharing their data and on farmers and end users who can enjoy more accurate data and less uncertain services.

AgriMetSupport can be employed also in contexts where there is an insufficient monitoring network coverage of the territory.
In fact, it comes with its own monitoring network, characterised by smart stations which are particularly suitable for temporary deployments and for fine tuning the parameters of the various models included in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{GCI }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{CPS }\DIFaddend \citep{Martino2019AFI}.
It must be stressed that the smart monitoring network is entirely optional, being a component like the others that can be simply removed if there is either an already excellent coverage of the territory or any micro-climatic monitoring is needed, therefore not preventing the use of AgriMetSupport in such scenarios. %\note{[add installation of low cost station by farmers]}

%In addition, more tailored services are provided through dedicated interfaces to automatically retrieve data. %(e.g. by means of a REST API).
Here, I present an overview of CPS interoperability within Agri\-Met\-Support.
As an interoperable CPS, it integrates multiple internal and external APIs, as illustrated in \cref{cyberPhysicalSystemFig}.
One external API is dedicated to handling HTTPS requests from stations transmitting coded messages containing sensor measurements. A PHP-based server listens for these requests, after which WeatherProg decodes the incoming data and ingests it into the database.
Another web API allows machine-to-machine requests, supporting Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse (FAIR) principles for digital assets. This API not only serves as a data delivery service for stakeholders but also enables the deployment of custom web applications, including tailored web mapping dashboards. These applications can even operate independently outside the Agri\-Met\-Support infrastructure, feeding external services.
Additionally, two internal APIs manage CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations over the point and raster databases, ensuring seamless integration and data accessibility within the system.
Together, these APIs ensure efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, enhancing the system’s interoperability and usability.

\section{WeatherProg engine}\label{sec:weatherprog}
\subsection{Main modules}
WeatherProg \citep{langella:weatherprog2014} is a computer program to automatically manage agrometeorological data.
The first implementation was carried out as the baseline asynchronous engine for the raw weather records handling in the (LIFE08 ENV/IT/000408) SOILCONS-WEB project.
It was developed because the main input requirements of the different modelling chains embedded in the project DSS \citep{Terribile:soilconsweb:2015} were the availability of both (i) complete and homogeneous time series and (ii) spatially exhaustive digital maps of the key agrometeorological variables (e.g. temperature and precipitation).

After the end of the project, the program has been progressively modified and updated in order to accommodate the requirements of both local government agencies (such as Italian Regions) and farmers, also thanks to an innovative cyber-physical infrastructure which WeatherProg is embedded in\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cref{cyberPhysicalSystemFig}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
)}\DIFdelend .
Indeed, WeatherProg can facilitate the work by a local administrative body which is in charge of managing and publishing agrometeorological data and of promoting measures for low pesticide-input pest management \citep{eu:dir128:2009}, for instance by producing bulletins based on bioclimatic indicators or on the results of pest simulation models.
WeatherProg can facilitate the work by a farmer too, since it supports for instance the implementation of an integrated pest management tool \citep{Terribile:dssvitis:2017} by configuring services in the context of Agriculture 4.0 and advanced IoT \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{framework as depicted in \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

\DIFaddend Nowadays, WeatherProg \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

Raw reports from a climatological network can be ingested and a different set of operations are performed ranging from the data checking to the delivery of gridded agrometerological variables.
Temperature, rainfall, relative humidity, solar radiation, atmospheric pressure and wind speed are the most commonly handled variables by the program at different time scales.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{WeatherProg starts automatically at predefined time intervals when a new report from the monitoring network is available (which depends upon the station data logger query frequency and not on the measurement frequency), and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{A scheduler within the WeatherProg engine handles the automatic execution of modules and }\DIFaddend carries out the following main operations \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

    \item Time scale aggregation. Variables are aggregated over time using \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{different statistics (}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{standard statistical measures -- such as }\DIFaddend minimum, maximum, average, sum, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{most frequent, and so forth) computed on 10-minutes measurementsafter the quality control }\DIFdelend and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{possibly the infill procedures are fulfilled.

    These calculations take place only after quality control has been applied.
    Infilled data are excluded, and only quality-controlled measurements of high reliability are included in the calculations; if they are insufficient, a missing value is created instead.
    This step generates new data forming time series at various temporal scales, such as hourly and daily.
    These newly generated data are considered raw and will undergo quality control and optional infilling.

    \item Point modeling. Complete and homogeneous time series about one or more variables at any monitoring station can be used to run a simulation model, such as crop growth, soil hydrological and pest risk models.
    WeatherProg already \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{embeds few }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{incorporates the calculation of several }\DIFaddend bioclimatic indicators and can \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{additionally include other models.

    Furthermore, as highlighted in \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cref{Fig:WeatherProg}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
, this module can be fed with time series extracted from the raster datacubes, enabling the simulation of any non-instrumented geolocation within the %DIF > available 
    spatial extent of the raster datacube.
    A concrete example is shown in \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cref{Box01:WeatherProg_Operations}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
, where a mechanistic model for a fungus operates as an external service and is executed at two randomly selected locations lacking sensor coverage.
    }\DIFaddend 

    \item Spatial interpolation\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and gridded data cubes}\DIFdelend . The spatial interpolation of sparse point data is performed considering the scale of the application that is requesting WeatherProg to produce the digital maps.
    \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Three-dimensional climatic data cubes (Easting, Northing and Time) are then formed enabling queries along any of the dimensions (such as slicing, dicing and trimming).
    }\DIFdelend According to the number of stations and to the density of the monitoring networks, different models of spatial interpolation can be activated, such as the IDW (parameterized inverse distance weighted), kriging (ordinary or iterative regressive), and a PRISM-like approach \citep{Daly08_PRISM_USA}.
    \DIFaddbegin 

    \DIFaddend \item Gridded \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{modeling. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{data cubes. Three-dimensional data cubes (Easting, Northing, and Time) are constructed by the stack of maps generated through spatial interpolation or gridded modeling, allowing queries along any dimension. 
    In \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

, a concrete example demonstrates how to slice a 3D data cube storing mean air temperature, enabling the extraction of either a time series (1D slice) at a specified spatial location %DIF > (i.e. Easting=525000 and Northing=4500500)
    or a digital map (2D slice) at a selected time. %DIF >  (i.e. ansi=2022-07-24T12:00:00.000Z).
    Possible operations on the data cube include slicing (extracting a subset along one or more dimensions), dicing (selecting a sub-cube by filtering all available dimensions), and trimming (refining the dataset, including clipping a raster to a selected polygon).
    }

    \item \DIFadd{Gridded modeling.
    }\DIFaddend Models and indicators available in the point modeling module can be run with grids of agrometeorological variables.
    In line of principle, gridded modeling can be implemented using two different approaches: a first approach in which the point model runs in time domain in a single point of the grid and then looping for all grid nodes.
    In a second approach, the code running the simulation model is written to accommodate array programming (at any time step all grid nodes are computed simultaneously) and moving forward in time domain step by step.
    In WeatherProg\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the former approach is already availablewhile the latter approach is under development using GPU computing .
    }%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, both approaches are already available, though array programming is currently being explored with GPU computing to further reduce computation time.
    In the example of \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

, Growing Degree Days (GDD) for Bactrocera dorsalis are computed using array programming on daily air temperature maps extracted from the raster data cube.
    Only the static map for a selected date is displayed, while the stack of daily GDD maps can be viewed as an animation (SHARED HERE FOR THE READER, ASK EDITOR).

\end{figure}
\DIFaddend In \cref{Fig:weatherprog:calls} a typical running schedule for air temperature is depicted, providing a reference to the specific case study of this work (i.e. Campania Region instance).
The schedule is composed of pipelines (each row in first column of Figure \ref{Fig:weatherprog:calls}) having different scopes which are orchestrated row-wise to manage all the basic and derived information required by \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{AgriMetSupport}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Agri\-Met\-Support}\DIFaddend .
The WeatherProg modules are the fundamental bricks used in the composition of schedules.
The key schedule parameters are the time scale of the target agrometeorological variable (e.g. 10 minutes), the pipeline execution frequency (e.g. every day) and the time domain extent (last 5 days) tackled by each pipeline run (first column of Figure \ref{Fig:weatherprog:calls}).
It means that the pipeline is executed every hour or every 3 days and works on a temporal window active only within the defined time extent, for instance from 6 days (-6d) to 5 days (-5d) before execution time.

This flexible configuration is further enhanced by the behaviour of the pipeline, since the schedule can have reanalysis and recursive pipelines in addition to a standard one (with a total of 10 rows, resulting in a corresponding number of pipelines in Figure \ref{Fig:weatherprog:calls}).

A reanalysis pipeline builds a progressively updated version of quality controlled and infilled data (ReA in Figure \ref{Fig:weatherprog:calls}).
To cite an instance, the persistence control type strictly depends on reanalysis to write a meaningful flag, since only adjacent records in the time series that have already passed logic and continuity control types (that is only auxiliary data of good quality) can contribute. % to the quality control procedure.
As time passes by, more auxiliary measurements are available within the time window of WeatherProg modules in execution (both before and after the target time being checked). 
Until the last execution of the reanalysis, which happens when the moving window is out of range for a target time element, an updated version of both quality checked and infilled data is produced (data and flags are overwritten) while infilled data undergo a separate process and are not subjected to quality control.
At this point, the time element, which is out of range of the moving window after the last reanalysis run, undergoes the recursion run.
A recursion pipeline (ReC in Figure \ref{Fig:weatherprog:calls}) is in charge of performing a quality check including infilled data and eventually performing a new infill procedure for each missing or anomalous singleton.
From now on, the time series is stable till the time element targeted by the last recursion run.

%The deviation or switch was introduced in the 10-minutes pipeline tackling the daily run dedicated to the creation of no-gap and certified data, as depicted in \cref{Fig:weatherprog:calls} . \note{(MODIFY THE FIGURE TO ADD THE DEVIATION/SWITCH GRAPHICALLY))}.

\subsection{Quality control\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{procedure}\DIFdelend } \label{sec:qcheck}
WeatherProg has a quality control module capable to managing data at 10 minutes, hourly and daily time scales.
The quality control can be of different types, such as range, continuity, persistence, climatological, spatial and temporal and not all quality control types are available neither at all time scales nor for all agrometeorological variables.
Possible flags for both any quality control type and the overall outcome are reported in \cref{tab:flagsSummary} with a short description for each flag.
\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{When a new AgriMetSupport instance is created a new database is created too.
Agrometeorological 10-minutes data are inserted for the first time and they can span for a day, for a month, for a year or even for longer time periods.
This is an initial condition (see }\textit{\DIFdel{initialize}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{in \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cref{Fig:weatherprog:calls}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
) in which all flags are switched to unchecked for all control types and to unprocessed for the overall outcome.
After the database is created with this first data ingest, WeatherProg is executed once carrying out a long-term run (LTR) on the whole available time series.
Taking as an example the schedule depicted in \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cref{Fig:weatherprog:calls} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
for air temperature, the LTR executes only the range control on the whole time series at first step and then a new LTR is executed adding the other control types step by step.
In the last step, the LTR executes the control types all together completing the initialization step.
Once the LTR writes all quality control flags, the high gear condition is met and WeatherProg can run the pipelines as outlined in the schedule of \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cref{Fig:weatherprog:calls}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
.
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{For simplicity, an overview of the quality control logic is presented only at the 10 minutes time scale for air temperature (\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cref{tab:qcheck_m10_airT}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
) both in this section and in section \ref{sec:QcheckValidation} where the quality control procedure will be validated.
There is an implementation logic based on 15 different combinations of four quality control types, namely range, continuity, persistence and spatial.
Each combination or row shown in \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cref{tab:qcheck_m10_airT} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
can be reached only if all previous combinations are not satisfied.
The sequence of combinations on rows depends on the absolute and relative weight given to each control type.
Let's provide few examples for any given datum.
If the range control type returns a wrong flag it is unnecessary to check any other control type and the overall quality control procedure has an outcome flag equal to wrong (ID=3 in \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cref{tab:qcheck_m10_airT}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
).
Further, if range is correct and continuity is wrong it is unnecessary to consider the flags for persistence and spatial control types and the overall quality control procedure has an outcome flag equal to wrong again (ID=8 in \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cref{tab:qcheck_m10_airT}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
).
Conversely, if range is correct and continuity is dubious than the spatial flag is relevant to get an overall outcome correct (ID=9 in \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cref{tab:qcheck_m10_airT}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
), wrong (ID=10 in \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cref{tab:qcheck_m10_airT}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
) or even dubious (ID=11 in \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cref{tab:qcheck_m10_airT}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
) according to the continuity status of other stations in the spatial neighbourhood of the station being processed.
In general, the implemented logic forces to reduce the probability of dubious flags since a dubious singleton is not discarded until either evidence or a human sets it as either correct or wrong.

for air temperature, the LTR first executes the range control on the entire time series before progressively applying the other control types, one at a time. 
This stepwise approach is necessary because the quality of the data affects the control procedure itself: in order to apply more refined checks, we need a reliable initial assessment of data validity.
By starting with range control, we establish a preliminary quality check, which then allows subsequent controls to refine the data evaluation without being misled by poor-quality inputs.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{An overview of the quality control logic is presented at the 10 minutes time scale for air temperature (\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cref{tab:qcheck_m10_airT}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
).
There is an implementation logic based on 15 different rules, each defined by a combination of four quality control types: range, continuity, persistence, and spatial.
Each rule is represented in \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cref{tab:qcheck_m10_airT} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
as a row and can be applied only if all preceding rules are not met.
The order or priority of the rules depends on the absolute and relative weight assigned to each control type and their combination.
Let's provide few examples for any given datum.
The first rule sets an unprocessed (UP) flag if any control type was not carried out (unchecked flag or UC).
The second rule ensures that the datum flag is set to correct if all control types have a correct flag.
If the range control type returns a wrong flag it is unnecessary to check any other control type and the overall quality control procedure has an outcome flag equal to wrong (rule 3 in \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cref{tab:qcheck_m10_airT}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
).
Further, if range is correct and continuity is wrong it is unnecessary to consider the flags for persistence and spatial control types and the overall quality control procedure has an outcome flag equal to wrong again (rule 8 in \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cref{tab:qcheck_m10_airT}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
).
Conversely, if range is correct and continuity is dubious than the spatial flag is relevant to get an overall outcome correct (rule 9 in \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cref{tab:qcheck_m10_airT}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
), wrong (rule 10 in \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cref{tab:qcheck_m10_airT}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
) or even dubious (rule 11 in \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cref{tab:qcheck_m10_airT}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
) according to the continuity status of other stations in the spatial neighbourhood of the station being processed.
In general, the implemented logic minimizes the likelihood of assigning dubious flags, as a dubious singleton is not discarded until either new evidence emerges or a human intervention classifies it as correct or wrong. 
Since quality control is performed on a moving window, the best assessment of a target value is achieved only when it is centered in the window and all auxiliary measurements within the window have successfully passed quality control. 
This is the reason why, for example, in \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cref{Fig:weatherprog:calls}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
, there is a pipeline dedicated to the reanalysis of 10-minute data, which is run once per day and involves the data of the last 5 days (the pipeline label is '}[\DIFadd{ReA}] \DIFadd{daily (-5d)').
However, this duration (5 days) does not correspond to the window length used in quality control.
For instance, if the window length for the quality control of target 10-minute measurements is $\pm100$ time steps, then it is plausible that measurements from day -5 to -3 have the best conditions for evaluation.

%Anomalies and missing data are all flagged to be %interpolated by means of an automatic linear regression procedure.
%infilled in order to get complete and homogeneous time series.
%Different methods are available such as a deterministic approach based on moving average with a growing kernel, or a statistical method approach using a stepwise multilinear regression using other stations after an iterative optimization step to properly select the time series length and the regression covariates.

WeatherProg has a module equipped with basic gap-filling methods which are dedicated to filling anomalies and data gaps.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{For the purpose of this paper, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In the AgriMetSupport instance for Campania region }\DIFaddend the infilling method \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{based on }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was configured to use the }\DIFaddend stepwise multiple linear regression (MLR)\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{was used in order to allow for a validation analysis (see \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cref{sec:QcheckValidation}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
)}\DIFdelend .
The MLR methods starts with the selection of all gaps and anomalies for any station within a given \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend interval of time \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{defined by the pipeline}\DIFaddend .
Then, for each datum to be infilled an optimisation block is executed iteratively on different time series lengths and on different numbers of regression covariates (i.e. the other stations used as independent variables in MLR).
Amongst the several regression models built for a missing or anomalous datum, the model characterised by the lowest RMSE is selected to predict the infilled value for that station in that date and time.
%The procedure is capable of dealing with all the anomalies and gaps while for any station found in a reference time interval.
Generally, the infill module avoids the selection of singletons that couldn't pass the quality check procedure. 
It means that data being potentially used as auxiliary but having flags different from correct or dubious are discarded from covariates.

%\review{ [...put here more text about the initialisation, also recalled in the end of Introduction.] }
This is of particular relevance considering huge limitations and constraints therein present.
Important limitations are the eco-environmental complexity of the study area, the scarcity of stations and the lack of long term time series for any station.
Other constraints are the urgent need for monitoring and sharing agrometeorological data in the regional territory %(highlight the important step forward thanks to our GCI)
and the urgent need for a system to assist the production of bulletins to help mitigate the effects of alien or autochthonous plant pests.

\cref{tab:rarSummary} lists some statistics about the station networks, while \cref{fig:rarLocations} illustrates the deployment of the stations over the territory of the Campania region.

\subsubsection{Agrometeorological network\label{RARStructure}}

The WMO-compliant agrometeorological monitoring network of the Campania Region comprises, at the time of this writing, only 34 stations, and this number is already insufficient to properly capture the complexity of the environment of the Campania Region (\cref{sec:StudyArea}).
To make things worse, the stations vary in their instrumentation, hence there is not any station which is capable of measuring all the 11 fundamental climatic variables, although each climatic parameter is measured by at least one station.
The bare minimum instrumentation includes sensors for air temperature, rainfall and air humidity, and 10 stations of the network measure only these three parameters.
The least monitored variable is air pressure, with only 9 stations currently measuring it.
Agrometeorological stations are located from \SIrange{10}{770}{\metre} above mean sea level, highlighting scarce coverage mainly of the mountainous territory (which covers 35\% of the regional area).

The monitoring network is in charge of the Agrometereological Regional Centre (CAR, \emph{Centro Agrometereologico Regionale}) under the Department for Agriculture of the Campania Region. The CAR is also in charge of producing pest risk bulletins for the agricultural farms of the Region.

\DIFaddbegin \statusblock{}{wip}{REVIEW THIS SECTION HAVING IN MIND THE NEW FIGURES, SPECIALLY \cref{Box01:WeatherProg_Operations}.}

\DIFaddend On hourly basis, CAR and DPC send each a bulletin containing the 10-minute measurements of the last 24 hours.
Each entry of the bulletin represents a point in time and includes the values of all the variables measured by any station.
The two bulletins are sent via sFTP to a server located on the premises of the CRISP\footnote{CRISP is an Interdepartmental Research Centre of the University of Naples Federico II focusing on the \textit{Earth Critical Zone}.}.

%As said earlier, data is sent from CAR on an hourly basis, containing all the measurements of the previous 24 hours.
To handle the hourly dispatch and provide data to the end users as soon as they are available, the system is configured to automatically have a run of WeatherProg every hour on both CAR and DPC networks, according to the schedule in \cref{Fig:weatherprog:calls}.
This hourly run is responsible for updating the database with the raw data related to the last hour.
Late updates of the incoming data are dealt with by a periodic run of a reanalysis pipeline, on both daily and monthly basis.
%This daily run works on the whole 24-hour incoming table, check which time ranges are missing within the database and fills them.

provides main statistics on air temperature data in relationship to the perturbation procedure, with two distinct days shown as examples.
To analyze the effect of perturbation on the statistical properties of air temperature, it is necessary to distinguish between raw unperturbed data (unchanged after perturbation), raw data before perturbation (original values prior to modification), and perturbed data (raw data that has been altered by the perturbation process).
%DIF > Even though comparing two days may not be entirely relevant, January 1, 2021 (winter) exhibits a lower mean temperature (\SI{6.5}{\degreeCelsius}) and is slightly skewed to the left, whereas July 19, 2021 (summer) has a significantly higher mean temperature (\SI{21.6}{\degreeCelsius}) and is strongly skewed to the right.
The perturbation mechanism exhibits a similar effect across seasons, despite differences in absolute temperature values. On both January 1, 2021 (winter) and July 19, 2021 (summer), perturbation increases the variability of air temperature measurements, as reflected in the higher standard deviation and interquartile range. This suggests that the perturbation process operates independently of seasonal temperature variations, preserving its statistical impact regardless of the underlying temperature distribution.
There is no difference (all statistics are the same) between the unperturbed raw data and the raw data selected for perturbation, confirming the robustness of the random selection mechanism in determining which data points are then perturbed.
%DIF > The interquartile range (IQR) and the standard deviation (SD) are larger in July, suggesting more variability in temperature during summer.

%We can think to a WeatherProg module as a black box to which agrometeorological data is passed as input and additional information (metadata) is attached to the original raw data, such as flags concerning the quality check procedure or infilled values which are predicted values substituting the raw ones because of their poor reliability.

\DIFaddbegin \subsection{\DIFadd{AgriMetSupport quality assessment}}
\statusblock{}{wip}{The quality of the AgriMetSupport system is evaluated based on several performance criteria, excluding assessments related to the system as a whole, such as decision support, user interaction efficiency, data dissemination effectiveness, and integration with external services.
Instead, the evaluation presented in this paper focuses on WeatherProg performance, which may vary depending on the configuration of a specific AgriMetSupport instance and, consequently, on the scheduling of pipelines.
In general, the criteria account for the system ability to produce continuous hourly and daily time series without gaps, as well as to generate hourly and daily spatial maps.
Specifically, an internal assessment is performed to monitor the system performance, to score it and then trigger alerts based on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The amount of data delivered (e.g., missing or incomplete records compared to expectations). Some thresholds are considered internally to avoid inconsistencies in the data, such as too many gaps (i.e. 30\%) for a particular station or a specific time element. An alert is generated and shared with data providers to acknowledge possible issues in the whole pipeline including the sensor, the station, the communication channel, the data provider database and relative management software, the data delivery mechanism, the AgriMetSupport API, the WeatherProg engine, and finally the internal point and raster databases.
    % I make examples to reply to possible comments by reviewers: for instance  why there is an issue about WeatherProg engine relaated to the amount of data delivered? Because issues can arise at any point in the pipeline in case data with gaps are delivered.
    \item The proportion of data that fails the quality control process, relative to the expected performance of approximately 90\%, which is assessed through the perturbation mechanism introduced during the validation procedure. An alert is generated to ensure that data streams and processing are functioning correctly.
    \item A cross-validated linear regression method is applied to each reconstructed datum, providing a direct measure of the system’s ability to generate real-time gap-filled data with reliable accuracy. An alert is generated if the RMSE exceeds a configurable threshold (e.g. \SI{1.5}{\degreeCelsius} for air temperature) over a significant portion of reconstructed data.
    \item The persistence of gaps after time series aggregation, quality control, and gap-filling, as these can hinder the ability to feed downstream applications, such as dashboards and services. No more than one gap per day and station is allowed and an alert is generated to signal potential issues and ensure timely intervention.
\end{itemize}
%The perturbation analysis, available through the validation procedure, quantifies the proportion of erroneous data, offering a means to track the accuracy of anomaly detection over time.

\subsection{\DIFadd{AgriMetSupport CPS}}
\DIFadd{Agri\-Met\-Support }\DIFaddend exemplifies a model \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{GCI }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{geospatial CPS }\statusblock{}{wip}{(I decided to remove GCI from the whole paper and use CPS instead)}  \DIFaddend that can be seamlessly customised to manage sensor networks across several territories.
Its design underscores pronounced multi-level granularity,
particularly evident in the flexibility afforded by its containerized deployment architecture. 
This granularity enables the distribution of its stack across the internet, for instance, allowing the data tier and the presentation tier to interoperate from distinct geographical locations. 
Moreover, the capacity to instantiate separate Docker containers for production pipelines (\cref{Fig:weatherprog:calls}) and testing or debugging purposes facilitates a robust development lifecycle.
Distinct databases for development and production -- associated to two different WeatherProg instances -- further enhance this segregation, ensuring that data integrity and application stability are maintained.

At a physical level, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{AgriMetSupport}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Agri\-Met\-Support}\DIFaddend 's granularity allows for the integration and management of disparate monitoring networks within a unified infrastructure.
This capability was demonstrated in the Campania Region case study, which showed the integration of CAR and DCP networks.
Furthermore, the system's architecture supports the incorporation of smart and low-cost stations, satisfying the requirements of precision agriculture and advanced Internet of Things (IoT) applications. %, albeit these applications were not explored in the case study for brevity.

\DIFaddend %The schedule of pipelines execution depicted in \cref{Fig:weatherprog:calls} is a clear evidence of a further level of granularity available within WeatherProg, which is the backbone engine of the whole cyber-physical system.
WeatherProg, serving as the backbone engine of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{AgriMetSupport}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Agri\-Met\-Support}\DIFaddend , facilitates a detailed and user-friendly management of standard, reanalysis, or recursive pipelines, as clearly highlighted in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{schedule }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{job scheduling }\DIFaddend shown in \cref{Fig:weatherprog:calls}.
This includes the activation of specific modules such as data decoding, quality control, and data infilling, tailored to particular monitoring networks, agrometeorological variables, and spatial and temporal scales.

The validation study performed on WeatherProg's quality control and data infilling modules illustrates the system's adeptness at processing and refining meteorological data (\cref{fig:perturbationCharts}).
Using artificially perturbed data -- as explained in the noisy data generation given in \cref{sec:QcheckValidation} -- in place of raw measurements from Regional bulletins allowed for a direct comparison of WeatherProg's capabilities in anomaly detection and data correction against the raw, original, and unaltered observations.

), }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, %DIF > (\cref{sec:qcheck}), 
}\DIFaddend the system is designed to minimize the probability of getting dubious flags, thereby reducing data ambiguity. 
Ambiguity must be reduced because a dubious singleton cannot be neither used nor discarded until either new evidence in WeatherProg logic or a human sets it as correct or wrong.
This strategic approach ensures a higher precision in anomaly detection, as evidenced by the minimal increase in mismatched outcomes (both false negatives and false positives) compared to a significant rise in accurately processed data points (both true positives and true negatives) when passing from version 1 to version 4 of the quality control module.
\cref{fig:perturbationCharts} delineates the evolutionary trajectory of WeatherProg's quality control mechanisms, showcasing enhancements driven by iterative feedback from the validation\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{studies}\DIFdelend .

}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{leading to improved classification accuracy. %DIF > which can also expand with the availability of larger datasets.
Initially, version 1 used a preliminary implementation of range, persistence, and continuity control types. 
However, it produced a high rate of mismatched outcomes (30\%), limiting its reliability.
In version 2, the spatial control type was added, significantly reducing mismatched outcomes (10\%), but at the cost of a high proportion of dubious flags (40\%), indicating excessive uncertainty in classification.
Version 3 introduced further refinements to the continuity and spatial control types, leading to a further reduction in mismatched outcomes (6\%) and a decrease in dubious flags (25\%), improving overall confidence in the results (70\% of accurately processed data point).
Finally, version 4 implemented a more advanced quality control logic (detailed in \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cref{tab:qcheck_m10_airT}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
), achieving optimal performance with mismatched outcomes minimized (5\%) and dubious flags reduced to just 5\%.
This evolution demonstrates how iterative refinements, allowed by perturbation and validation, progressively enhanced WeatherProg's anomaly detection accuracy -- which is outstanding, aligning obtained results closely with the expected performance of approximately 90\%.
}\statusblock{}{wip}{While version 4 successfully minimizes both mismatched and dubious outcomes, further improvements could be explored to enhance reliability in handling borderline cases where uncertainty still remains.
Future refinements may involve dynamic thresholding techniques or adaptive quality control methods to better differentiate between ambiguous and truly erroneous data.}

% - 
Correct quality control outcomes are made by both true positives (non perturbed data with correct outcomes) which account for 68.52\% of the data and true negatives (perturbed data with wrong outcomes) which account for 21.54\% of the data. 
Overall, the quality check module returns a total of 90.06\% of correct outcomes from the data processed during validation (\cref{tab:validation_outcomes}).
Incorrect quality control outcomes are made by both false negatives (non perturbed data with a wrong outcome) which account for 0.46\% of the data and false positives (perturbed data with a correct outcome) which account for 5.98\% of the data. 
Overall, the quality control module returns a total of 6.45\% of incorrect outcomes. 
Focusing on false positives, the distribution of random noise added to raw measurements shows that approximately 45 \% falls within the range $[0,\; \pm1]$ and about 47\% falls within the range $[\pm1,\; \pm2]$. 
This finding confirms that the quasi totality of perturbed data are incorrectly flagged as correct only because of the slight deviation from the raw original value.
Only 0.73\% of the quality control outcomes are wrong (both in false positives and in false negatives) because all modules were wrong, while in the majority of the other cases the spatial module was dubious and the persistence module had unreliable auxiliary data.
This situation arises since a high volume of data was forced with noise, while in standard operational conditions these outcomes are highly reduced and therefore a higher performance of the quality control module is expected.
In fact, real-world anomalies are predominantly dense (one station for a short interval of time) whereas in the proposed validation the noise was randomly spread across all stations and throughout any date and time within the year. 
The remaining 3.47\% of outcomes are dubious and the majority of them (2.49\%) are perturbed data. This highlights again the expectation of a good performance in identifying possible anomalous data in operational contexts.
The validation study shown in \cref{tab:validation_outcomes} highlights an impressive efficiency of WeatherProg's quality control, with a high percentage of well-fitted outcomes demonstrating the system's precision in handling agrometeorological data. 
High percentages of well-fitted outcomes versus low percentages of mismatches are pivotal to state that a significant majority of data points were accurately processed. 
This indicates a robust anomaly detection capability within WeatherProg, essential for reliable agrometeorological analysis.

\DIFaddbegin \subsection{\DIFadd{Gap-filling}}
\DIFaddend The quality control module produces wrong outcomes (about 22\% of the whole data) including both true negatives (21.54\%\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, corresponding to perturbed data identified as wrong outcomes in \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cref{tab:validation_outcomes}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend ) and false negatives (0.46\%\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, corresponding to unperturbed data incorrectly flagged as wrong in \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cref{tab:validation_outcomes}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend ).
The gap-filling procedure is performed after the quality control in WeatherProg pipelines and it uses an optimised stepwise multilinear regression \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(MLR)}\DIFaddend .
Each datum flagged as wrong \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(or any other flag different from correct or dubious) }\DIFdelend is passed to the MLR algorithm to get a predicted value.

\subsection{\DIFadd{Limitations and future improvements}}
\begin{itemize}

    \item \DIFadd{The quality control is not as well developed for other variables as it is for air temperature. Improvements will be carried out also combining distinct variables to aid the check accuracy.
    }

    \item \DIFadd{Data reconstruction for highly stochastic variables, such as rainfall, is not feasible for real-time applications (using 10-minutes or hourly data), whereas temporal aggregations from daily scales onward can be achievable. Future developments will include signal decomposition of time series and machine learning techniques to enhance quality control, even including other agrometeorological variables.
    }

    \item \DIFadd{Spatial interpolation methods cannot always be fully automated, as required by CPSs like AgriMetSupport.  
    While it is technically possible to apply a deterministic interpolation, such as IDW (as performed in step 7 of \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cref{Box01:WeatherProg_Operations}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
), at higher temporal scales (e.g., 10-minute or hourly) without violating assumptions, significant limitations remain.  
    These include: (i) the inability to capture spatial auto-correlation (e.g., air temperature with itself) and spatial cross-correlation (e.g., air temperature with auxiliary environmental covariates such as elevation) hidden in the data, (ii) the inability to leverage spatial relationships to inform the interpolation mechanism, and (iii) the difficulty in obtaining results that resemble the underlying random spatial process generating the data.  
    In contrast, statistical techniques, such as various forms of kriging (}\statusblock{}{wip}{cite Goovaerts book}\DIFadd{), impose statistical constraints that are difficult or even impossible to fully automate.
    An improvement is related to the completion of a PRISM-like approach which is knowledge-based and enables an automated implementation.
}

    \item \DIFadd{WeatherProg modules are written using different softwares, such as Python, R and MatLab while a scheduled improvement will consist to homogenise the code between modules and above all prefering free and open-source languages.
}

    \item \DIFadd{Time consuming calculations, such as those carried out by spatial interpolation over large areas, cannot be easily executed in real-time on small data centres. 
    An attempt was performed to translate the PRISM approach to work in the CUDA framework using GPU computing.
    This enabled to speed-up the calculations about 100 times.
    A future improvement will be to incorporate GPU-computing for PRISM-like model and other demanding or real-time applications.
}

    \item \DIFadd{The dashboard dedicated to a sensor network manager is not yet ready. It means that a responsible entity (i.e. local government agencies, researchers, consortia of farmers, and others as defined in the introduction) cannot manage the instance using a front-end but everything must be done by command line.

\subsection*{Funding}
The groundwork for this research was significantly supported by funding from two sources. 
The initial phase was underpinned by the SOILCONS-WEB project (LIFE08 ENV/IT/000408), an initiative aimed at promoting soil conservation and the adoption of sustainable land management practices. 
It was during this foundational phase that I had the opportunity to develop the WeatherProg core engine, an endeavor that not only aligned with but also significantly contributed to the SOILCONS-WEB project's objectives of advancing environmental sustainability through technological innovation.

Subsequent support from the Phytosanitary Service (UOD21) of the Directorate General for Agricultural, Food and Forest Policies of the Campania Region (DG7), within the URCoFi Executive Plan (2016-2022), further facilitated the refinement and expansion of the WeatherProg engine, including the integration of smart stations and the development of web services, to address contemporary agricultural challenges.
